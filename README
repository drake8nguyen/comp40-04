Architecture of compress40
  - Compression
    * Reads in the image
    * Trims the edges, returns a trimmed version of the image
    * Maps through the trimmed image, converts R, G, B values in
      each pixel to Y, Pb, Pr values
    * Calculates a, b, c, d, index of Pb, and index of Pr when mapping
      through a 2x2 block
    * Packs a, b, c, d, index of Pb, index of Pr values in a 2x2 block
      into a 32-bit word in the big-endian order
    * Prints out the list of 32-bit words in row-major order

  - Decompression
    * Reads in the header of the compressed file
    * In row-major order, populates a 2D array with read-in packed 
      32-bit words
    * Unpacks the 32-bit word, and calculates a, b, c, d, index of Pb, index
      of Pr values.
    * Calculates Y, Pb, Pr for each pixel in a 2x2 block using
      the calculated a, b, c, d, index of Pb, and index of Pr values
    * Converts the Y, Pb, Pr values in each pixel to R, G, B values
    * Creates an image object with calculated RGB pixels
    * Prints out the decompressed image
  
For this assignment, it took approximately 10 hours to 
analyze the problem. Once the problem was analyzed, it took
approximately another 25 hours to solve the problem.
